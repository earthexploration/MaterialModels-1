UMATs for various constitutive models

Material models are arranged in parent folders for small and finite strains

The most relevant material model (Viscoelastic - Viscoplastic) along with their material parameter descriptions for MOAMMM project are located in:

    FiniteStrain/Finite_VEVP
    SmallStrain/SS_VEVPD

Sample .inp files are also located in the respective folders
